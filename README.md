# MeteoTyrol
This is the Github that deployes the Website [MeteoTyrol](meteotyrol.github.io).
We hope that by public contributions this project can stay running and up to date.

## How it Started
This webpage started as a final project for the course [Web-Mapping](https://webmapping.github.io) in Summer Semester 2025 by [Jessica Längle](mailto:jessica.laengle@student.uibk.ac.at) and [Johanna Schramm](mailto:johanna.schramm@student.uibk.ac.at).

The website is aimed at members of the Institute of Atmospheric and Cryospheric Sciences Innsbruck. It  gathers important weather, climate and air quality data for Tyrol in one place.
