# MeteoTyrol

## How it Started
This webpage started as a final project for the course [Web-Mapping](webmapping.github.io) in Summer Semester 2025 by [mailto:jessica.laengle@student.uibk.ac.at](Jessica Längle) and [mailto:johanna.schramm@student.uibk.ac.at](Johanna Schramm).

The website is aimed at members of the Institute of Atmospherice and Cryospheric Sciences Innsbruck. It aims to gather important weather, climate and air quality data for Tyrol in one place.

We hope that by public contributions this project can stay running and up to date.
